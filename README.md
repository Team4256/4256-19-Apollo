## Overview

### The subsystems that make up our 2019 robot include (in no specific order):
#### Swerve Drive
##### a unique omnidirectional drivetrain with 4 independent wheels with 360 degrees of freedom.
#### Hatch Intake
##### an outward clamp that utilizes a single double solenoid to secure a hatch by moving it outward and then release it by moving it back inward.
#### Ball Intake
##### a single-motor driven vectored wheeled intake with ominwheels in the center to insure balls are consistantly in the middle for accurate shooting.
#### Intake Lifter
##### a two-motor driven rotational arm that moves down to aquire balls and place hatches on the rocketship and up to aquire hatches and place them on the cargoship.
#### Ground Intake
##### a single-motor driven rotational arm with a single-motor driven wheeled intake used to suck hatches up from the ground and rotate them up to the hatch intake.
#### Limelight Vision
##### a vision camera used to autonomously track the targets on the field to both place cargo and hatches on the cargoship and pickup hatches from the loading station. 
#### Climber
##### a two-pneumatic-cylinder system that boosts each half of our robot up to hab 2 one at a time. 
#### LED Strip
##### a led strip that updates based on whether the limelight detects a vision target, the ball intake has a ball, etc.

### Autonomous
#### For fully autonomous actions that require no driver interaction we utilize a modified version of Team 254, The Cheesy Poofs, autonomous planning java code.

### Naming:

#### Classes:
##### Class names are nouns that begin with a capital letter and maintain camel-case.

<code>class IntakeLifter;</code> 

<br>

#### Methods/Functions:
##### Method names are verbs that begin with a lowercase letter and maintain camel-case.

<code>slurp();</code>

<br>

#### Variables:
##### Instance Variables begin with a lowercase letter and maintain camel-case. 

<code>double desiredDegrees;</code>

##### Constant Variables are written in all caps with underscores seperating words.

<code>double MAXIMUM_ANGLE;</code>

<br><br>

### Some Common Code Examples:

#### If Statement:

<code>if (condition) {
    
}</code>
<br>

#### If-Else Statement:

<code>if (condition) {

} else {
